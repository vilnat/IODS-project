#Script for data wrangling for weeks 4 and 5 (Scroll down for Week 5)

#Considering the script name, is it time to discuss birds and bees?
#First, let's read some data:
hd <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/human_development.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
gii <- read.csv("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_2218/datasets/gender_inequality.csv", stringsAsFactors = F, na.strings = "..")

#Let's check what's in the datasets
str(hd)
dim(hd)
summary(hd)
# So the first dataset contains information about countries and how they're doing based on the Human Development Index and some related variables

str(gii)
dim(gii)
summary(gii)
#And the same for gender equality

# I don't know if I was supposed to find some metafile giving out actual shorter variable names, so I just named these myself
colnames(hd)
library(dplyr)
hd <- hd %>% rename("hdiR" = "HDI.Rank", "country" = "Country", "hdi" = "Human.Development.Index..HDI.", "lifeExp_birth" = "Life.Expectancy.at.Birth", "eduExp" = "Expected.Years.of.Education", 
                    "meanEdu" = "Mean.Years.of.Education", "gni" = "Gross.National.Income..GNI..per.Capita", "gni_min_hdiR" = "GNI.per.Capita.Rank.Minus.HDI.Rank")
colnames(hd)

colnames(gii)
gii <- gii %>% rename("giiR" = "GII.Rank", "country" = "Country", "gii" = "Gender.Inequality.Index..GII.", "maternalMort" = "Maternal.Mortality.Ratio", "adolBirth" = "Adolescent.Birth.Rate", 
                      "parliament" = "Percent.Representation.in.Parliament", "edu2F" = "Population.with.Secondary.Education..Female.", "edu2M" = "Population.with.Secondary.Education..Male.",
                      "labourF" = "Labour.Force.Participation.Rate..Female.", "labourM" = "Labour.Force.Participation.Rate..Male.")

#Now we'll create two new variables by calculating the ration between women and men in education and workforce
gii$eduRatio <- gii$edu2F / gii$edu2M
gii$labourRatio <- gii$labourF / gii$labourM

#Let's join the datasets
human2 <- inner_join(hd, gii, by = "country")
head(human)
#Looks good enough

#And save
write.table(human, "data/human.csv")

# The dataset consists of 19 variables and 195 observations (countries) describing the human

#And finally let's add country names as the index of the dataset rather than a column name
